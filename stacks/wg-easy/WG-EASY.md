## Before proceeding with installation, make sure to do the following (or else everything will become a mess):
- Edit the docker-compose.yml file, following the steps below:
  - Replace all instances of <home-router-external-ip> with the actual IP address of your home router (e.g., 54.734.989.12)
  - Replace <your_secure_password> with a (secure) password
